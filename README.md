Python Tutorials for PS 452: Text as Data 

This repo was prepared for a Stanford Class, PS 452.   I - Gregory Dillon-  came across it, found it helpful.  I anupdated the code to python 3 syntax, used the more modern requests module, changed the targeted class names that are currently being used on the afl-cio website, and minor updating changes.   I was unable to get the web-page to show in a Jupyter notebook in Google Colaborate, so I cut that part of the tutorial out.   Also, I think its necessary to look at the web page in the browser console, and put some description of using right-click and inspect to see the underlieing html/css/javascript.   Further references would be helpful, and there are many.

This repo contains tutorials prepared for a Stanford course on text analysis in Fall 2014. The tutorials are available in html and ipython notebook format; the content is identical. The tutorials cover basic python programming, data structures, and web scraping. They are written for users with basic competency in R but no formal computer science training.
